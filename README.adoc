== About
Runtime implementation for _ghostwriter-api_ that provides application flow tracing of your application.
The traced data is sent to either the standard _System.out_ or to an _SL4J_ handler.

== Overview
To summarize what it does, lets take the before/after output of a simple https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoodGrind/ghostwriter-sample/master/fizzbuzz/src/main/java/io/ghostwriter/sample/fizzbuzz/FizzBuzz.java[FizzBuzz] implementation.

=== Before

=== After
Using the SLF4J writer (_ghostwriter-tracer-slf4j_), with a _TRACE_ level configuration for _SLF4J_.

== Getting started

First, you need to compile your application with GhostWriter. For details on how to do that, check the Todo:link[README].
With that step done, all that remains is to use the correct dependencies at runtime.

=== Maven

TODO: add relevant sample section

=== Gradle

TODO: add relevant sample section

== Extending

The _ghostwriter-rt-tracer_ module provides a default string serialization and output strategy.
In order to override the default behaviour custom implementations of the relevant interfaces should be provided.
The _ghostwriter-rt-tracer_ uses the service loader pattern and will use the first implementation found on the classpath.

=== Custom serializer

To provide your own serialization logic just create an implementation for the _TracerSerializer_ interface.

TODO: add TracerSerializer interface section

=== Custom writer

In case you want to dump the tracing information in a different way, provide your own implementation of _TracerSerializer_.
